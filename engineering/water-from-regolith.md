Extracting Water from Lunar Regolith
===

[back to Engineering](../Engineering.md)

This is a more theoretical document focused on engineering solutions for extracting water from lunar regolith. It's mostly continued from the `Electrolysis of Water` section of [Overview](../Overview.md).

## Theory

The regolith would need to be contained, and potentially pressurized. Hypothetically speaking, if you were to put a ton of regolith immediately into a container that maintained a vacuum but didn't allow vapors to escape, you could transport it to the next stage of processing. You'd want to find your regolith near concentrations of water, which would more than likely be quite a bit below the surface and also frozen.

Methods for getting the water from the regolith after it is contained, could vary. You could pressurize the container and shake it around. That would lower the boiling point, and if the container was kept at an optimal temperature, you'd have liquid water. You could also pressurize the container, keep the temperature at the boiling point of water at that pressure, and introduce a flow of gas while you shake the container around. This would move the vapor from between bits of regolith and it would follow the flow of gas. Conditions have to be optimal, though, and planned very well. This is all theory, at the moment of writing this.
