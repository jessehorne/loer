Extracting Water from Lunar Regolith
===

[back to Engineering](../Engineering.md)

This is a more theoretical document focused on engineering solutions for extracting water from lunar regolith. It's mostly continued from the `Electrolysis of Water` section of [Overview](../Overview.md).

## Theory

The regolith would need to be contained, and potentially pressurized. Hypothetically speaking, if you were to put a ton of regolith immediately into a container that maintained a vacuum but didn't allow vapors to escape, you could transport it to the next stage of processing. You'd want to find your regolith near concentrations of water, which would more than likely be quite a bit below the surface and also frozen.

Methods for getting the water from the regolith after it is contained, could vary. You could pressurize, which would lower the boiling point of the water and then shake it around. If the container was kept at an optimal temperature, you'd have liquid water. You could also pressurize the container, keep the temperature at the boiling point of water at that pressure, and introduce a flow of gas while you shake the container around. This would move the vapor from between bits of regolith and it would follow the flow of gas and could be contained. Conditions have to be optimal, though, and planned very well. This is all theory, at the moment of writing this.

Ben's research (resource #1), brings up an important point for us to consider when engineering solutions to this problem. Lunar mega-regolith has several advantages over the regolith. The regolith contains a high concentration of dust, which is usually a compacted bulk of small materials, usually less than 50Âµm(#2).

This dust presents a major problem but can potentially be solved with various solutions. One property to note about the dust is that because of the amount of Iron(2), much of the dust appears to be ferromagnetic. This could be a blessing and a curse. Electric motors on the Moon would likely end up covered in the dust, as the magnets would attract it over time. This could be detrimental to long term functionality of the motors in our drills, vehicles, life support systems and so on. This dust isn't like dust on Earth. It may be small but it's also sharp.

Magnets would also give us a way to filter (first stage) the dust without a pressurized atmosphere that would involve a traditional means of filtering air through a specially design material. That traditional form of filtration would still need to be maintained in a pressurized habitat to catch dust mixed with our air.

At around 10 meters, you can expect to hit mega-regolith. The mega-regolith isn't composed mostly of dust, like the regolith. It contains compacted concentrations of various material. Mining operations would more than likely happen below the regolith. While we could still process regolith to get some materials that we'd need, it would be wiser to go below the regolith and focus on the mega-regolith.

One strategy for Water Extraction from Lunar Regolith, as Ben suggested, would be to make it just a part of an overall process. Like the method mentioned above, we'd seal the (mega-)regolith in a pressurized container, and then periodically raise the temperature. Each element would volatilize at a specific temperature. Water would be among the first to go. As elements volatilize, we'd collect them and move onto their various next-stages.
