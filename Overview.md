## The Problem
Lunar Homsteader's are faced with an interesting problem, with an efficient solution being vital to the success of any sustainable colony/habitat/homestead/study, on the Moon. They need to be able to breathe. That is obvious but the solution to the problem isn't always as clear.

To begin, we'll examine the methods for keeping astronauts breathing aboard the ISS. This will give us a good starting point for determining the best ways to provide our Lunar Homesteader's with oxygen.

I think it's important to note that the earth's atmosphere has a roughly 4:1 ratio of Nitrogen to Oxygen. We breath around 20% oxygen. Breathing 100% oxygen can be deadly(7). Which will affect this research, but for now I will focus on just the issue of Oxygen. For further study, check our resource #8.

### Electrolysis of Water

According to [Space Answers](www.spaceanswers.com)(4), the primary method for providing oxygen for astronauts aboard the ISS is through the electrolysis of water. Electrolysis is the process of using a direct electric current to drive a chemical reaction(2).

The electrolysis of water can split H2O into separated Hydrogen and Oxygen molecules. It can be a win-win because Hydrogen can also be used as a fuel source in some cases. Otherwise, it gets pumped out because you don't want to keep flammable material around unless it's going to be useful.

Through the Sabatier reaction(5), you can also end up using that hydrogen along with carbon dioxide, 300-400°C, some pressure and a nickel catalyst to produce methane and water. So there's high desire and potential to recycle, but I digress.
