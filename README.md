Lunar Oxygen Extraction Research
===

Lunar Oxygen Extraction Research is a research project for [Lunar Homestead](http://lunarhomestead.com/), originally created by Jesse Horne and maintained by the Lunar Homestead Crew.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to investigate efficient methods for extracting Oxygen on [Luna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna), the Earth's moon. While we do this, we will document our findings and our own research on the subject. The "finished" product will be a collection of research and documentation of procedures for extracting Oxygen from the Moon.

The importance of Oxygen, for Lunar Homesteaders, is obvious. The reason I believe this project is important is because it gives a clear and concise explanation and also non-academic friendly procedures on how we could obtain Oxygen from the lunar regolith.

There is certainly a lot of research and information available, already, on the subject, with physical products and solutions offered by different organizations. With that being said, the goal of this project follows the [Lunar Homestead](http://lunarhomestead.com/) pledge to release accurate, informative research which is open for all to see, use and expand upon.


TL;DR

LOER is a research project on extracting Oxygen from the Moon. This document will teach you about current and proposed methods for doing so along with other relevant information a Lunar Homesteader might need to know when they're on the Moon.

# Where's the rest of the research?

coming soon...
